## **Project Summary**
This part of the project extends our work on 3D solid objects by incorporating advanced lighting models in OpenGL to enhance realism. It's a hands-on exploration of essential 3D graphics programming concepts, such as object rendering, shader application, and dynamic lighting techniques.

### **Features**
- Utilization of OpenGL in C/C++ for rendering 3D graphics.
- Support for various lighting models: Phong, Ambient, Diffuse, Specular.
- Implementation of custom shaders for detailed lighting and shading effects.

## **Directory Structure**
- **`bin/`**: Contains the executable file.
- **`lib/`**: Custom libraries for OpenGL manipulation in C.
- **`res/`**: Shaders storage.
- **`src/`**: Source code, including subfolders for rendering (`solid`) and environment setup (`world`).
- **`Makefile`**: Facilitates compilation with necessary flags.

## **Key Components**
- **3D Solids Rendering**: Procedures for initializing and animating objects with lighting effects.
- **Shader Management**: Detailed explanation of vertex and fragment shaders for 3D visual effects.
- **Lighting Techniques**: Exploration of different lighting calculations within shaders for realism.
